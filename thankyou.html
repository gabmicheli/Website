  <h1> Thank You from the Students </h1>
  
  
  <p>Dear Donors:</p>
<p> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Thank you for making this possible. Our trip to New York was easily the most ambitious and successful field trip of our high school experience. From Harlem to Times Square, our class was given a studiously planned journey throughout the city. I have no doubt that the trip did a great deal to imprint the lessons of class into our memories and better concrete our unit on immigration and the Harlem Renaissance.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Harry Hirsch</p>

<p>Thank you donors for making this trip possible. I enjoyed every moment and truly appreciate the new experience it gave me. I don't think I have ever felt so affected after walking out of a museum or felt such a sense of community after watching a play. Being able to connect what I learned about the great migration and Immigration to America to places it actually happened in like the tenement museum and Harlem, gave me a much better grasp on what  read in a textbook and how it is in real life.</p>
  <p>Thank you very much</p>

<p>Thank you for granting the amazing opportunity of visiting the Big Apple to me and my peers! I recently went on another school trip to New York City and without the help of donors, students were unable to go on the trip, because they could not afford the cost of the trip. Thanks to you, 85 students were able to experience in person what they’ve been learning in class, which contributes massively to the learning process. Some students hadn’t even been to New York City before this trip, and because of you, they had an astounding and exciting first visit to the Big Apple! As a musical lover, I know that tickets aren’t cheap, and so I am especially grateful for the opportunity you gave us to see Come From Away. The show was fantastic! In addition, I really enjoyed going on the walking tours in Harlem and the Lower East Side, because I could imagine myself living as an immigrant or migrant, and walk around the same areas they did!</p> 

<p>This trip was truly amazing, and my peers and I are so lucky and grateful to have you as sponsors to help us take our learning to the next level, and visit New York City!</p>

<p>This trip is an experience I will never forget. Without your donations, I never would have gone to the 9/11 memorial, seen Come From Away, walked Harlem and gone up the World Trade Center. In my opinion seeing Come From Away was a priceless experience, it was a life changing show. As someone who was born after 9/11, I have seen many videos of the towers falling but watching Come From Away made me experience the raw fear and sorrow everyone felt. I am so incredibly grateful for this opportunity you provided us. We never would have gone on this trip without your donations. </p>

<p>Thank you very much to the donors who allowed us to go on this great trip for such a low price and thank you for giving us such amazing opportunities. I appreciate it very much to be given this opportunity and I wouldn’t be able to have this trip without your help. This trip was important to me because not only was it my first time going to New York, but I got to experience so many amazing things that I probably wouldn’t have been able to experience if I had just went for vacation so I really am thankful towards you all for helping me be able to go on this trip. </p>

<p> Thank you so much for making our trip to New York City possible. It was incredibly fun and educational. I was able to apply lots of things I had been learning in class and was able to learn many new things that I did not know before. Because of your donation, we were able to experience an amazing city with many amazing opportunities for a very affordable cost. </p>

  <p>Thank you so much for all of your generosity!</p>

<p>The opportunity to go outside the classroom and learn is something I really enjoy. Not only is it a break from the school environment, but it allows new thoughts and new ideas in a new space. Our school doesn’t have opportunities other schools might, but you gave us the opportunity. </p>
  <p>Thank You, </p>

<p>Thank you, Donors, though I don't know your each and everyone of your names, I thank you so much for sending the money that made it able to take us on the trip. The sights of New York was amazing to see, the food was good, and the trip was overall a very pleasant experience. This trip was important to me because it was first out of many places that I will go for traveling and for educational purposes. Once again thank you. </p>

<p>Thank you so much for making this New York trip possible. All of our activities were amazing and meaningful to our learning. My understanding of what we are studying in class has greatly improved. All of the tours and experiences were very meaningful. Your money was not wasted; It was spent in the best ways possible: helping others, and education.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>A thankful student.</p>
